    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This sandwich is called a 'Media Noche' which translates to 'Midnight.' It
      is not exactly a "traditional" Cuban sandwich, for those of you fortunate
      to have had one, but this one makes a wonderful dinner sandwich because it
      is served hot. A nice side dish is black bean soup or black beans and
      rice, and plantain chips. COOKS NOTE: Bust out your Foreman Grill, or
      Panini Press! Please note: this is an adopted recipe and I hope to make it
      soonest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the sandwiches are assembled, it's important to press them well while
      toasting them. If you have a panini press, you can use that. Otherwise,
      the easiest thing to do is to set a second heavy skillet on top of the
      first, and then press down on that. Only with enough pressure will you
      achieve the sandwich's signature compact, crisp look.
