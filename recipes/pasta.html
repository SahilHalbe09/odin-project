    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      is a pasta dish made with fettuccine, butter, and Parmesan cheese. As the
      cheese is mixed with freshly cooked, warm fettuccine and ample butter, it
      melts and emulsifies to form a smooth, rich cheese sauce coating the
      pasta. Originating in Rome in the early 20th century, the recipe is now
      popular in the United States and other countries. Outside of Italy, cream
      is sometimes used to thicken the sauce, and ingredients such as chicken,
      shrimp, salmon or broccoli may also be added when it is served as a main
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dish is named after Alfredo Di Lelio, a Roman restaurateur who is
      credited with its invention and popularisation. Di Lelio's elaborate
      tableside service was an integral part of the recipe's success. Fettuccine
      Alfredo is a richer variant of standard Italian fettuccine al burro
      ('fettuccine with butter') or pasta burro e parmigiano ('pasta with butter
      and Parmesan cheese'). It is a kind of pasta in bianco, that is, without
      added sauce. Italian recipes do not include cream and are not topped with
      other ingredients, nor is the dish generally called "Alfredo" in Italy.
