    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Ratatouille is a French Provençal dish of stewed vegetables that
      originated in Nice and is sometimes referred to as ratatouille niçoise
      Recipes and cooking times differ widely, but common ingredients include
      tomato, garlic, onion, courgette (zucchini), aubergine (eggplant,
      brinjal), capsicum (bell pepper), and some combination of leafy green
      herbs common to the region, such as chives or fennel.

      The Guardian's food and drink writer Felicity Cloake wrote in 2016 that,
      considering ratatouille's relatively recent origins (it first appeared in
      1877[unreliable source]), there exists a great variety of methods of
      preparation for it. The Larousse Gastronomique claims "according to the
      purists, the different vegetables should be cooked separately, then
      combined and cooked slowly together until they attain a smooth, creamy
      consistency", so that (according to the chair of the Larousse's committee,
      Joël Robuchon) "each [vegetable] will taste truly of itself."
